## Description
The project explores the implementation of an exact optimization algorithm and a heuristic algorithm (genetic algorithm) to solve the travelling salesman problem.
The exact algorithm was implemented in [IMB OPL](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio) while the genetic algorithm was implemented in Python using the [deap library](https://github.com/deap/deap). Parameter exploration and tuning was done with the [Python library hyperopt](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt).
Both models were run on 80 instances with different number of points, using different time constraints: 0.1s, 1s, 10s, 30s, 80s and the results were compared.
A [final report](https://github.com/damnko/travelling-salesman-problem-opl-genetic-python/blob/master/report.pdf) was generated, summarising the results achieved in the project.

## Project structure
* [001-generate-points.py](https://github.com/damnko/travelling-salesman-problem-opl-genetic-python/blob/master/001-generate-points.py) Contains the logic for generating the point distributions, the script previews the generated distribution and stores it inside the respective `/points` folders after user approval;
* [002-optimize.py](https://github.com/damnko/travelling-salesman-problem-opl-genetic-python/blob/master/002-optimize.py) Runs the optimization process through a batch script that calls the OPL solver, this is done on all instances created at the previous step. The OPL model is stored inside the `/opl-model` folder;
* [003-extract-results.py](https://github.com/damnko/travelling-salesman-problem-opl-genetic-python/blob/master/003-extract-results.py) Extracts the results from the files generated by OPL at the previous step and stores them in a convenient way in the `results.json` file;
* The files [genetic_model.py](https://github.com/damnko/travelling-salesman-problem-opl-genetic-python/blob/master/genetic_model.py) and [helpersGeneticAlgo.py](https://github.com/damnko/travelling-salesman-problem-opl-genetic-python/blob/master/helpersGeneticAlgo.py) contain the implementation of the genetic algorithm using the deap python library and some custom functions for crossover and mutation;
* [004-hypspace-exploration.py](https://github.com/damnko/travelling-salesman-problem-opl-genetic-python/blob/master/004-hypspace-exploration.py) Performs the parameter space exploration for the genetic algorithm using the hyperopt python library;
* [005-parameter-exploration-analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/damnko/travelling-salesman-problem-opl-genetic-python/blob/master/005-parameter-exploration-analysis.ipynb) Is a jupyter notebook performing the analysis on the results of the parameter space exploration;
* [006-optimize-genetic.py](https://github.com/damnko/travelling-salesman-problem-opl-genetic-python/blob/master/006-optimize-genetic.py) Runs the optimization process with the genetic algorithm, this is done on all instances created at the first step;
* [007-genetic-algo-animation.ipynb](https://github.com/damnko/travelling-salesman-problem-opl-genetic-python/blob/master/007-genetic-algo-animation.ipynb) Generates an animation showing the evolution of the individuals across the various generations of the genetic algorithm;
* [008-analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/damnko/travelling-salesman-problem-opl-genetic-python/blob/master/008-analysis.ipynb) Is a jupyter notebook performing the analysis on the performances of the exact and genetic algorithms.
